# **useEffect**

- **What it is**: 
  - `useEffect` is a Hook in React used to handle **side effects** in functional components. Side effects include tasks like **fetching data**, **updating the DOM**, **setting timers**, or **subscribing to external services**.
  - It's called after the component renders, allowing you to perform actions based on certain conditions (dependencies).

### **Why we use `useEffect`**
- You mentioned a great use case with **API calls**:
  - When a page loads, we often want the UI to load first so users don’t see a blank screen. Once the page has rendered, we use `useEffect` to make the **API call** in the background. 
  - This provides a better **user experience**, as they can see the UI immediately, and the data loads in the background.
  
  For example:
  ```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    // Make the API call here
    fetchData();
  }, []); // Empty dependency array ensures this runs after the first render only
  ```

- **Rendering behavior**:
  - When the API data comes back, the component re-renders, but this happens quickly enough that users usually don't notice.
  
### **Dependency Array**
- You also mentioned **dependencies**, which are important in controlling when `useEffect` runs.
  - The **dependency array** (the second argument in `useEffect`) allows you to specify what changes will trigger the effect to run again.
  
  Examples:
  - **No dependencies**: Runs after every render.
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
      console.log('Runs on every render');
    });
    ```
  - **Empty dependency array**: Runs only once after the initial render (like `componentDidMount` in class components).
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
      console.log('Runs once after first render');
    }, []);
    ```
  - **Specific dependencies**: Runs when one or more specific variables change.
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
      console.log('Runs when count changes');
    }, [count]);
    ```

### **Example: API Call Using `useEffect`**
Here’s how you could use `useEffect` to fetch data after a component renders:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((result) => {
        setData(result);
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, []); // Empty array: fetches data only once when the component mounts

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {data && <div>Data: {data.someProperty}</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **Best Practices**
- **Cleanup function**: If your `useEffect` subscribes to something (like WebSockets or event listeners), return a cleanup function to avoid memory leaks:
  ```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = subscribeToService();

    return () => {
      // Cleanup function
      subscription.unsubscribe();
    };
  }, []);
  ```

- **Avoid unnecessary API calls**: By managing dependencies correctly, you can avoid making unnecessary API calls or running the effect too often.

# **Routing in React**

- **What is Routing?**:
  - In React, **routing** helps navigate between different components (views) of a **Single-Page Application (SPA)**.
  - Unlike traditional websites where navigating between pages causes a full-page reload, React uses **client-side routing** to dynamically update the UI without reloading the page. This improves **performance** and **user experience** by only rendering the part of the UI that changes (like the body, while keeping the header and footer the same).

### **How does Routing work?**
- **Single-Page Application (SPA)**:
  - React enables building SPAs, where the **entire application is served as one HTML page**.
  - When you navigate from one view (e.g., "Home") to another (e.g., "About" or "Contact"), only the necessary part of the UI (usually the body) is updated, while the rest of the UI (like the header and footer) stays the same.
  
  This makes the application faster and more responsive.

### **React Router**
- **Installation**:
  - To use routing in React, we install **React Router** using:
    ```bash
    npm install react-router-dom
    ```
  
- **Core Components**:
  - **`createBrowserRouter`**:
    - This function is used to create the router instance for a browser-based environment. It defines the different routes and components for your app.
    - Similar to the **react.createElement**, it helps define the structure of your application’s routes.
    
    ```jsx
    import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';

    const router = createBrowserRouter([
      { path: "/", element: <Home /> },
      { path: "about", element: <About /> },
    ]);
    ```

  - **`RouterProvider`**:
    - This component wraps your application and provides the defined router configuration to the app. It enables the routing mechanism to work throughout the app.

    ```jsx
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
    ```

- **Outlet**:
  - **What is `Outlet`?**:
    - `Outlet` is a special component used in **nested routes**. It acts as a placeholder in the parent route, where child routes will be rendered.
    - This is useful when you want certain parts of the UI (e.g., header and footer) to stay the same, while other parts (e.g., the body) change depending on the route.
    
    Example:
    ```jsx
    <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
      <Route path="home" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="about" element={<About />} />
    </Route>
    ```

    Here, `<Layout>` might contain a `Header`, `Footer`, and an `Outlet`. The `Home` or `About` component will be rendered inside the `Outlet` when you navigate to those routes.

- **Link Component**:
  - In HTML, we use the `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute to navigate between pages. In React, we use the **`Link` component** for navigation to prevent full-page reloads.
  - **Syntax**:
    ```jsx
    <Link to="/about">About</Link>
    ```
    - `to`: This prop defines the path where the link will navigate.

- **Client-Side Rendering**:
  - React Router supports **client-side rendering** (CSR), meaning it handles navigation **entirely within the browser** without the need to fetch a new page from the server.

You're absolutely right about **Dynamic Routing**. Let's expand on that idea and refine the explanation to fit into your notes.

### **Dynamic Routing in React**
- **What is Dynamic Routing?**
  - Dynamic Routing allows us to create routes that can accept **dynamic parameters** in the URL. This is useful when we want to display different content based on the specific item the user selects, such as a **product page** for a specific category of items (clothing, footwear, etc.).

  For example, if you're building an e-commerce app, you might have different categories like **Clothing**, **Footwear**, and **Accessories**, and each category would have its own set of products. By using dynamic routing, you can define a route for a product page and dynamically load the content based on the category or item ID.

### **How Dynamic Routing Works**
- **Route Parameters**:
  - Dynamic routes are defined with **URL parameters**. These parameters are passed in the URL and can be accessed within the component using **`useParams`**, a hook provided by React Router.
  
  **Example**:
  ```jsx
  <Route path="/products/:category" element={<ProductList />} />
  ```

  - In this case, the `:category` part of the URL is dynamic. When a user navigates to `/products/clothing`, `:category` will be replaced by the value `clothing`.

### **useParams Hook**
- **What is `useParams`?**
  - `useParams` is a React Router hook that lets you **extract URL parameters** from the route. This is useful when you need to load data based on the dynamic part of the URL, like fetching products based on a category or ID.

```js
  import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

  function ProductList() {
    const { category } = useParams(); // Extract the 'category' from the URL

    // Use the 'category' to fetch the relevant products
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Category: {category}</h1>
        {/* Render product list based on the category */}
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

### **Advantages of Dynamic Routing**
- **Scalability**: With dynamic routing, you can easily scale your app to handle different types of content without creating a separate route for each one.
- **Efficiency**: It allows you to handle many similar routes with a single route definition, reducing redundancy.


### **Example Code with React Router**
### **Full Dynamic Routing Example**
Here’s how you can structure a simple routing setup:

```jsx

import React, { lazy, Suspense } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import Header from "./components/Header";
import Body from "./components/Body";
import About from "./components/About";
import Contact from "./components/Contact";
import Error from "./components/Error";
import { createBrowserRouter, Outlet, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
import ResturantMenu from "./components/ResturantMenu";

const Grocery = lazy(() => import("./components/Grocery"));

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="root">
      <Header />
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
};

const routeElement = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <App />,
    children: [
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <Body />,
      },
      {
        path: "/about",
        element: <About />,
      },
      {
        path: "/contact",
        element: <Contact />,
      },
      {
        path: "/grocery",
        element: (
          <Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading....</h1>}>
            <Grocery />
          </Suspense>
        ),
      },
      {
        path: "/restaurants/:resId",
        element: <ResturantMenu />,
      },
    ],
    errorElement: <Error />,
  },
]);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(<RouterProvider router={routeElement} />);
```
