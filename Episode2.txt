1. NPM (Node Package Manager):

You mentioned "NPM is a package manager." It might be helpful to add that npm is the default package manager for Node.js and helps in managing both local and global dependencies in a project.

2. Package.json:

Your note says, "package.json is a configuration of npm." It's more precise to say that package.json is a manifest file for a Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project, such as the project name, version, scripts, and the list of dependencies.
Dependencies:

3. dependencies :- Your notes correctly mention that dependencies are packages that your application depends on. Dependencies are of two types

3.a. Dev Dependencies:

The note says, "required in a development phase," which is correct. You could specify that these dependencies are only needed for development and are not included in the production build, using the --save-dev flag when adding them with npm.

3.b. Normal Dependencies: Used during production


4. Difference between package.json and package-lock.json:

The notes state that package-lock.json keeps the exact versions of the packages. This is correct. It might be beneficial to clarify that package-lock.json ensures that the same versions of dependencies are installed across different environments, providing a more stable build.


5. node_modules :

You mentioned, "package.json contains all the dependencies for our application," whereas node_modules contains all the code that is required to run all those packages. 

6. Transitive Dependencies:

The concept of transitive dependencies is correct, but the explanation is a bit unclear. Transitive dependencies are those that a direct dependency depends on. For example, if your project depends on Library A, and Library A depends on Library B, then Library B is a transitive dependency for your project.

7. Difference between ^ crate and ~ tilda
^ -> works for minor updates in our application like update our application with the latest minor update version
~ -> works for major updates in our application like update our application with the latest major update version

<------------------------ Some package code ------------------------------>

npm init -> This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.

npm install parcel -> the command npm install parcel, it installs the Parcel bundler and adds it as a dependency in your package.json file. 

Function of Parcel: Parcel is a web application bundler that takes your source files (like JavaScript, CSS, and HTML) and bundles them into a smaller, more optimized package for production. Itâ€™s known for its zero-configuration approach, meaning it requires minimal setup to work.

Purpose in a Project: Parcel simplifies the process of preparing your code for deployment by handling tasks like file minification, asset bundling, and code splitting, among others. This helps in improving the performance of your web application.

Importance of Parcel :-
- Dev build
- local server
- HMR - Hot Module Replacement
- File Watching Algorithm -> written in c++
- caching -> faster builds
- Image optimization
- minification
- bundling
- compress the file
- consistent hashing
- code splitting
- differntial bundling
- diagnostics
- Error handling
- Https
- Tree shaking - remove unused codes

Now the question arise how we will connect our app with react with those cdn links

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Namaste React</title>
</head>

<body>

    <div id="root">
        <h1>I will be replaced by the root.render</h1>
    </div>

    <script src="./App.js"></script>

</body>
</html>

As we can see there is no cdn links . so to connect our app with the react we need to run  command 
npm install react -> this command will install the react in our application

in our package.json we can see we have react installed
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1"
  }

similarly we need to install the react-dom
npm install react-dom

  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1"
  }

App.js:25 Uncaught ReferenceError: React is not defined --> we get a error React is not defined
this is because we have only installed the react but we have not used in our application

<----------------------------------------------------------------> 

so how we can use it lets see

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const element = React.createElement("div", { id: "parent" }, [
  React.createElement("div", { id: "child1" }, [
    React.createElement("h1", { id: "print" }, "I am an H1 tag"), //array of childrens for child
    React.createElement("h2", { id: "print2" }, "I am an H2 tag"),
  ]),
  React.createElement("div", { id: "child2" }, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "I am an h1 tag"),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, "I am an h2 tag"),
  ]),
]);


// To render something in the dom in react we use react-dom
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));


// now to render the created element on the browser we have to render it using the react-dom.
root.render(element);

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; so this two import will help to import react to our application. and these imports are coming from node_modules.

Add the type="module" attribute to the <script> tag.

@parcel/transformer-js: Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports. this is the error we are getting Browser script cannot have imports or exports means 

    <script type="module" src="./App.js"></script>

we need to make the changes in our script that is we need to add type="module" to the <script> tag
and what the use of this is
The type="module" attribute allows the use of ES6 modules, meaning you can use import and export statements in your JavaScript files.

The App.js file is expected to contain your React components and the logic to render them into the DOM, typically using ReactDOM.render() or createRoot().render().
